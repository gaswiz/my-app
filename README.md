### **📌 README.md – React App Deployment Exercise**  
**Metropolitan College - Web Development Exercise**  

## **📝 Project Overview**  
This project is a **React.js application** built as part of an exercise for **Metropolitan College**. The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to:  
- Set up and run a React project using **Create React App (CRA)**.  
- Manage dependencies and build the project.  
- Deploy a React app to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions** for automation.  

The final application is live and can be accessed at:  
🔗 **[https://gaswiz.github.io/my-app/](https://gaswiz.github.io/my-app/)**  

---

## **📌 Features & Learning Objectives**  
✅ **React Setup** – Created a new React app using Create React App (CRA).  
✅ **Development Environment** – Installed Node.js and set up dependencies.  
✅ **Building the App** – Compiled the project using Webpack & Babel.  
✅ **GitHub Integration** – Managed the repository using Git & GitHub.  
✅ **Automated Deployment** – Configured GitHub Actions to deploy the project to GitHub Pages.  
✅ **Production Optimization** – Minified the app for performance improvements.  

---

## **📂 Project Structure**  
The project follows the standard **React app structure**:

```
my-app/
│── node_modules/       # Dependencies installed via npm
│── public/             # Static assets (index.html, icons, etc.)
│── src/                # React components and app logic
│   ├── App.js          # Main React component
│   ├── index.js        # Entry point of the React app
│   ├── index.css       # Global styles
│── package.json        # Project metadata & dependencies
│── .github/            # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
│── .gitignore          # Files ignored by Git
│── README.md           # Documentation (this file)
```

## **🚀 How to Run the Project Locally**  
### **1️⃣ Install Node.js (if not already installed)**
Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If not installed, download from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

---

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gaswiz/my-app.git
cd my-app
```

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Before running the project, install all required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### **4️⃣ Start the Development Server**
To run the React app in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
- The app will open in your browser at: **http://localhost:3000/**
- Any changes to the code will automatically reload.

---

## **🛠️ How to Build & Deploy**
### **📦 1. Create a Production Build**
To generate an optimized build for deployment:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a **`build/`** folder containing the **production-ready** React app.

---

### **🚀 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Automated)**
We have configured **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy the React app.  
Every time new code is pushed to the `main` branch, the app will be rebuilt and deployed.

- **GitHub Actions Workflow:**  
  The deployment is managed via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which:
  1. Installs dependencies  
  2. Builds the project  
  3. Deploys it to GitHub Pages  

You can manually trigger deployment by running:
```bash
git push origin main
```
This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and publish the latest version online.
